 3D Design
To make a 3d there are many ways
- Converting 2d to 3d
- Making 3D shapes and make operation on all of them together

Constructive solid geometry
- begin with the basic shapes then make operations on these shapes as union and intersections

# Inkscape

- If i want to work on an project that includes cutting a sticker on vinyl cutter i have to know the actual dimensions that i want to cut
- Create a new document with these dimension
- If the resolution is low so the output product will be bad
- If i increase the resolution that will make it better
- We begin to import the wanted image, it is better to be a high resolution so the difference in color appears
- Tracing bitmap : `path.trace bitmap`
- Export image as png
- Options : `page,600 dsi`
- vinyl needs about 600, pcb needs about 1000 to 1200
- `http://fabmodules.org/`
- `png , vinyl.
- To preview the contents of the `camm` file i use the command `cat file-name.camm`
- `fs` : force , `vs` : speed , `pu` : pen up , `pd` : pen down
