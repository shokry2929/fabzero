# Vcarve

- used to make paths to cut a design on shopbot
- first we create a new file
- define job size : x and y, x is the logest side and y is the shortest
- then define the depth or the thickness of the job
- then define the origin which is `0 , 0 `
- then units in mm or inch
- then okay
- then import the design
- define what process we need on
