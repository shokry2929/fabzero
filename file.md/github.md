- i cannot delete a specific thing but i can delete all the history
- The github works line continuing blocks every bloack depending on the last one ... so that's why it is called block chains
- Google doc can be used and it uses the same method of chain blocks, but the problem you have to restrict to google docs because i have to follow their rules
- ssh key using : combine of two parts (private key, public key), private key with me only and public key will be available of all people, these two together initiate ssh key
- how to generate ssh key in my computer
- if the private hub became with some one else so he can push data and there is no security, if this happend i should delete the public key on the github and create new one
