vsing a 3D printer is not as easy as you think. Yes, there are plug and play 3D printers that work straight out of the box, but you’ve got to be wise when it comes to choosing a 3D printing machine because at one point, you are likely to encounter a problem and you’ve got to know the ins and outs to resolve the issue. So, here are some 3D printer tips for you.

    Choose a 3D printer that has good support

Choose a 3D printer that has good supportThere are cheap 3D printers online, but if you are to choose one, you have to consider the manufacturer and the support available. It’s best if you get one from a local supplier for more accessible support.

In this way, if you encounter any problem, you can easily approach them and have it fixed. No need to ship it and wait for weeks to get it fixed.

    Level the Bed and set the nozzle

Level the Bed and set the nozzleI already mentioned this above, leveling the bed and setting the nozzle will improve the quality of your 3D print. You can use a sheet of paper to determine the distance between the nozzle and the bed.

When the nozzle is clean and inappropriate distance from the bed, the paper will have minimal resistance when pulled free. It will also go back underneath the nozzle without force.

How to know if you need to level the bed? Here are some signs that you should look out for to know that you need to level the bed.

    Filament height and width varies
    Gaps between lines of filament vary
    The filament is sticking to the build surface only in some places

Here are some signs that you have to set your nozzle gap because it’s either too big or too small.

Nozzle too high

    Filament doesn’t stick to the build surface
    Filament comes out as spaghetti 

Nozzle too low

    The first layer is barely visible or too thin
    The nozzle plows trough filament already on the build plate
    Filament gathers on the nozzle
    No filament extrudes on the build plate

    Check the nozzle temperature

Check the nozzle temperatureBe careful with the nozzle temperature because if it’s too hot, it could leave strings of filament between separate parts. When building tall pieces, a high temperature melts the earlier layers that may result in malformation.

To avoid this mistake, include a one-centimeter cube built on the opposite side of the build plate. This removes the hot nozzle from the print and allows enough time for cooling. 

    Equip yourself with the right tools

Equip yourself with the right toolsIt’s important that you have all the tools needed to set up the machine and to keep yourself safe.

Index card. This comes handy when setting the bed level and adjusting the nozzle gap.

Screwdriver or hex key. You will need this to adjust the screws on the bed.

Flush cutters. This very helpful for removing the support material and makes a nice, clean cut when trimming filament before loading.

Heat-resistant gloves. This will keep you safe when you are working around a hot nozzle. This is very important for students who are 3D printing in classrooms.

Clean cotton cloth and a brass brush. You will use this for cleaning the nozzle.

Calipers. This is absolutely necessary when trying to model parts that have to fit in specific places or when you just need an idea of how big a model actually is.

Razorblade or spatula. This is very helpful when scraping residue from the surface of the build plate.

Dish soap and clean, dry cotton cloth. This is useful for removing dust and grime.

Isopropyl alcohol. This is effective in cleaning a build surface that is permanently mounted to the 3D printer. 

    Find the sweet spot of your 3D printer’s temperature

Find the sweet spot of your 3D printer’s temperatureAdjusting the bed to the right temperature is crucial in producing the best results because it helps with print adhesion. As the machine prints the model, each layer shrinks as it cools and the eds of the print pull away from the build plate.

Also, when the bed temperature is too high, the model may develop the so-called “elephant foot.” When you observe this, you should slightly reduce the bed temperature for the next print.
