vinyl cutter
Notes

Don't use roll from the center
If any one made mistage i take a photo of the mistake with paper write on it the mistake to make sure no one do that again
When put the blade in it's holder it should be hidden for eye but can feel it by hand only
The holder of the blade shouldn't be very tighten, just closed well
There is optical sensor in the moving head
It's better to create an outside rectangle when creating any design to be easy to stick
Fabmodulas is better than cut studio because it's faster
The prober way to store the roll is by using solotip or mask tap or something like that to keep the roll closed and keep it horizental
There is a small space in the bottom back of the vinyl to attack the holder of the roll
Maintainence

Clean the machine periodically from the dust
The rubber stripe where the blade goes down should not be in good condition, and if it is not in good condition it should be replaced
Use iso probeller to clean the sensors or any other alcohol but without water
Testing the blade

Check the blade using eye loop or digital microscope and check if the blade not broken
Cheese software can be used after connecting the digital microscope and select it as the active camera then check the blade condition
Put the roll in the machine
Insert the roll in the space specified for the roll
Put the two wheels under the white spots, and on the roll
Power on the machine and select roll
Long press on test
If the blade is good, the circle should be removed easily and the square stayes as it is
