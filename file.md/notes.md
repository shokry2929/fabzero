# Notes

- Pull learning better than push learning
- Let them fail to learn
- Give them tools to make their jobs not instructions
- Things will go wrong
- Things will continuously change
- You will lose work
- You will break things
- You will not be able to find a solution immediately
- image consists of small blocks called matrix
- if i resize the image to smaller then try to revert it back again, that will destroy the image, it's better to make a new file
- it is better to work on one thing only on the same time
- It's better to document the machine condition and projects the created on it
- Sharing economy : i will get benefig alot
- Hidden file in linux startes with .
- fablabs.io contains personal info. about me
- github is monitored by google easily not gitlab.fabcloud.org
- if you stops world will continue
- Any thing can be done on any OS,but why we use linux : to go out of the comfortable zone and much powerful, faster and more secure and another reason the windows make me always a user and a consumer but ubuntu let be modify and can change every thing
- 3D desin software like solidworks is an advanced software, and my lab doesent need all of these features, software like freecad can do the task and i can modify it to make what i want
- We want to change our way of thinking by solve my problem by myself not waiting someone to solve me my problems
- Why not using word or any other software to edit ?? any software can be died in a few years so my data will be lost, so by typing my data by normal editor i can do whatever i want
- i should write in the description of the fablabs.io that lab not allowed for outside school fans
- if two different people working on the same repository, if one of them modify the file then push and the other one modify then push that will give me error, so i should pull first then modify then push
- making new file contain every commands i want then sh file name to execute (nano filename ... making file ... save ... sh file name)
